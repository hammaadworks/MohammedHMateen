## THE WHY

**bismillah alhamdulillah wa salaatu wa salaamu
ala rasoolullah (saw) allahu akbar!**

**YA RABB, let me never forget my 'Why', my dream, fully funded by You and You
alone.
just for one purpose: To please You, YA RABB, by Your Mercy, Love and Grace!**

* To earn in this world only to spend in Your cause.
* To establish businesses of halaal provisions as opportunities to feed the
  hungry, shelter the poor, empower the needy and spread goodness to the entire
  Ummah of Rasoolullah SAW.
* To build tech as digital fortress, uniting the Ummah of Rasoolullah SAW and
  spreading the truth of Islam far and wide.
* To be a shield for the oppressed and needy of all kinds and protect all from
  evil and champion the good with every brick I lay and every line of code I
  write.
* To come closer to You, and our beloved Rasoolullah SAW.

Aameen. YA RABB AL AALAMEEN.

**YA RABB**, I have fallen before, hit my lowest point in regret, shame, and
wasted potential.
But I am not done. A believer never despairs from the mercy of ALLAH (SWT).
This is my redemption arc, **YA ALLAH SWT**, my disciplined return to purpose,
fueled by faith, consistency, and relentless effort.

**YA RABB, my heart aches for the Ummah.**

People are hungry, they need food, clothes, shelter and necessities of life, yet
all **we truly need** is **You, YA RABB**.
Help me, my parents and my family, so we can help them, take care of them,
provide for them and please YOU, YA RABB.
Grant love in the hearts of spouses, just as you placed love and mercy between
our beloved Rasoolullah SAW and his family. Unite the hearts of the Ummah just
as Rasoolullah SAW spread love and brotherhood amongst us. Aameen.

I see the pain of my brothers and sisters across the world.

* In **Yemen**, they struggle for a single meal.
* In **Palestine**, **Burma**, and **Rohingya**, our families are robbed of
  their homes, their lives, their children, and their safety. The children of
  Palestine, striving to protect the sanctity of Your home, Masjid al-Aqsa, are
  brutalized and demoralized.
* Our **Uyghur** sisters are being choked of their voice, rights and honor.
  Protect their izzah and the izzah of all the women of the Ummah of Rasoolullah
  SAW, YA RABB, for You are the best of protectors.

This is the result of our own wrongdoing, but You are Ar-Rahman, the Most
Merciful. Your mercy encompasses everything. Let my work be a means of Your
Mercy on Earth such that:

* People in need are supported, protected, and empowered.
* Students do not have to abandon education for labor.
* No child goes malnourished, no woman feels threatened, and none is left in the
  dark, hurt, neglected and unheard.
* The wealth gap shrinks and the poor are uplifted with their necessities of
  life including healthcare made affordable and covered.
* Knowledge, opportunity, and resources are shared widely, strengthening
  communities, uplifting the vulnerable, and spreading hope to all.

**YA RABB, Your houses are beautiful, Your deen is pure, and Your sent messenger
Rasoolullah SAW is true.** Help me to serve them. Guide our entire Ummah, the
youth, the elders, men and women to the straight path. Make me, my parents, my
family, my lineage, and the entire Ummah rich in character, honor, and closeness
to You, both in this Dunya and the Aakhirah, so that we may serve You better,
strive in Your cause, and offer praise, thanks, and worship to You alone. Grant
us a place in Jannah next to You and our beloved Rasoolullah SAW. Aameen

**Remember your purpose!** You are a Muslim tech entrepreneur, driven by a noble
vision to serve ALLAH SWT, follow Rasoolullah SAW, and provide for your family
and the Ummah.

No excuses. No delays.
Only **discipline**, **consistency**, and **total commitment**.
Every move for ALLAH SWT and in the footsteps of Rasoolullah SAW.

**To build your legacy, brick by brick, one line at a time.**

**YA RABB, ALHAMDULILLAH FOR EVERYTHING.**

**AAMEEN YA RABBAL AALAMEEN.**
