# My Daily Covenant: A Pledge to ALLAH, Family, and Ummah

### My "Why": The Unyielding Fire

**Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim.**

**YA RABB, let me never forget my 'Why'. This is the reason I rise, the reason I strive, the reason I build.**

My dream, fully funded by You and You alone, is for one purpose: **To please You, YA RABB.**

*   To earn in this world only to spend in Your cause.
*   To build **InMasjid** not as an app, but as a digital fortress to unite the Ummah of SAW in love, peace, and Deen.
*   To use its channels for Halaal education, for live Khutbahs, to spread the truth of Islam far and wide.
*   To establish a **Halaal Stock Exchange** through it, creating a pure financial ecosystem for the believers.
*   To make the **ZupFam App**, the **YumYum App**, the **Chai Stall**, the **Turf Ground**, and the **Co-working Space** not just businesses, but engines of opportunity—to feed the hungry, shelter the poor, and empower the needy.
*   To be a shield for the orphan, the widow, the wrongly accused, the youth, the elderly, and the oppressed everywhere.
*   To protect from evil and champion the good with every brick I lay and every line of code I write.
*   To come closer to You, and Your Beloved SAW, with every single breath, and to stand before You in Arafat with my family, having performed a Hajj accepted by You.

**YA RABB, my heart aches for the Ummah.**

People are hungry, they need food. They need shelter. They need basic necessities. All we truly need is You, YA RABB. Help me and my family, so we can help them. Grant love in the hearts of spouses, just as you placed between our beloved Prophet SAW and his family.

I see the pain of my brothers and sisters across the world.
*   In **Yemen**, they struggle for a single meal.
*   In **Palestine**, **Burma**, and **Rohingya**, our families are robbed of their homes, their lives, their children, and their safety. The children of Palestine, striving to protect the sanctity of Your home, Masjid al-Aqsa, are brutalized and demoralized.
*   Our **Uyghur** sisters are being choked of their voice and their honor. Protect their izzah, YA RABB, for You are the best of protectors.

This is the result of our own wrongdoing, but You are Ar-Rahman, the Most Merciful. Your mercy encompasses everything. Let my work be a means of Your mercy on Earth.

*   Let my success mean that farmers in need are supported.
*   That students do not have to abandon education for labor.
*   That the sick can afford healthcare.
*   That the wealth gap shrinks, and the poor are uplifted.
*   That no child goes malnourished, no woman feels threatened, and the weak are not neglected.
*   That the people of Dharawi have dignified homes.

**YA RABB, Your houses are beautiful.** Help me to serve them. Guide our entire Ummah—the youth, the elders, men, and women—to the straight path. Make my family, our Ummah, and me rich in character, honor, and closeness to You, both in this Dunya and the Aakhirah.

Grant us a place in Jannah next to You and Your Beloved SAW.

**YA RABB, ALHAMDULILLAH FOR EVERYTHING.**

**AAMEEN YA RABBAL AALAMEEN.**

*   Your sincere repentance and renewed, unshakeable determination.
*   The shame you felt, now transmuted into an unyielding fire of ambition.
