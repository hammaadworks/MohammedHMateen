## THE WHY

**bismillah alhamdulillah wa salaatu wa salaamu
ala rasoolullah (saw) allahu akbar!**

**YA RABB, let me never forget my 'Why', my dream, fully funded by You and You
alone.
just for one purpose: To please You, YA RABB, by Your Mercy, Love and Grace!**

* To earn in this world only to spend in Your cause.
* To establish businesses of halaal provisions as opportunities to feed the
  hungry, shelter the poor, empower the needy and spread goodness to the entire
  Ummah of Rasoolullah SAW.
* To build tech as digital fortress, uniting the Ummah of Rasoolullah SAW and
  spreading the truth of Islam far and wide.
* To be a shield for the oppressed and needy of all kinds and protect all from
  evil and champion the good with every brick I lay and every line of code I
  write.
* To come closer to You, and our beloved Rasoolullah SAW.

Aameen. YA RABB AL AALAMEEN.

**YA RABB**, I have hit my all-time low in regret, shame, broken promises and
wasted potential. My worship of You, YA ALLAH SWT, was far from what it should
have been, nor did I consistently follow the righteous guidance and profound
teachings of Rasoolullah SAW as commanded, nor did I strive to give my beloved
parents and family the rights they truly deserved. I recognize that I have
messed up in all fields, often staying in a state of delusional misguidance.

But I refuse to give up, **YA RABB**! A believer never despairs from the mercy
of ALLAH (SWT). I acknowledge all my errors, wrongdoings and resolute to fix
every single one them, with Your powerful help, **YA RABB**. This is my
redemption arc, **YA ALLAH SWT**, my disciplined return to purpose, fueled by
unwavering faith, steadfast consistency, and relentless effort:

* **To restore honor and success** to my beloved parents and family.
* **To firmly adhere to the Sunnah** of my beloved Rasoolullah SAW.
* **To strengthen my worship,** seeking greater closeness to You, YA ALLAH SWT.

**YA RABB, my heart aches for the Ummah.**

People are hungry, they need food, clothes, shelter and necessities of life, yet
all **we truly need** is **You, YA RABB**.
Help me, my parents and my family, so we can help them, take care of them,
provide for them and please YOU, YA RABB.
Grant love in the hearts of spouses, just as you placed love and mercy between
our beloved Rasoolullah SAW and his family. Unite the hearts of the Ummah just
as Rasoolullah SAW spread love and brotherhood amongst us. Aameen.

I see the pain of my brothers and sisters across the world.

* In **Yemen**, they struggle for a single meal.
* In **Palestine**, **Burma**, and **Rohingya**, our families are robbed of
  their homes, their lives, their children, and their safety. The children of
  Palestine, striving to protect the sanctity of Your home, Masjid al-Aqsa, are
  brutalized and demoralized.
* Our **Uyghur** sisters are being choked of their voice, rights and honor.
  Protect their izzah and the izzah of all the women of the Ummah of Rasoolullah
  SAW, YA RABB, for You are the best of protectors.

This is the result of our own wrongdoing, but You are Ar-Rahman, the Most
Merciful. Your mercy encompasses everything. Let my work be a means of Your
Mercy on Earth such that:

* People in need are supported, protected, and empowered.
* Students do not have to abandon education for labor.
* No child goes malnourished, no woman feels threatened, and none is left in the
  dark, hurt, neglected and unheard.
* The wealth gap shrinks and the poor are uplifted with their necessities of
  life including healthcare made affordable and covered.
* Knowledge, opportunity, and resources are shared widely, strengthening
  communities, uplifting the vulnerable, and spreading hope to all.

**YA RABB, Your houses are beautiful, Your deen is pure, and Your sent messenger
Rasoolullah SAW is true.** Help me to serve them. Guide our entire Ummah, the
youth, the elders, men and women to the straight path. Make me, my parents, my
family, my lineage, and the entire Ummah rich in character, honor, and closeness
to You, both in this Dunya and the Aakhirah, so that we may serve You better,
strive in Your cause, and offer praise, thanks, and worship to You alone. Grant
us a place in Jannah next to You and our beloved Rasoolullah SAW. Aameen

**Remember your purpose!** You are a Muslim tech entrepreneur, driven by a noble
vision to serve ALLAH SWT, follow Rasoolullah SAW, and provide for your family
and the Ummah.

No excuses. No delays.
Only **discipline**, **consistency**, and **total commitment**.
Every move for ALLAH SWT and in the footsteps of Rasoolullah SAW.

**To build your legacy, brick by brick, one line at a time.**

**YA RABB**, grant me the means and wisdom to generate **30 Crore INR** through
halaal means, solely for Your pleasure and the benefit of Your Ummah. Aameen.

**YA RABB, ALHAMDULILLAH FOR EVERYTHING.**

**AAMEEN YA RABBAL AALAMEEN.**

		   Masajid by creating a personalized user feed with relevant information.
		4. **Sadaqah Jariyah Platform:** A secure and transparent donation system.

* **Guiding Principle:** Our endeavor is firmly rooted on
  _**"wa ati allah wa ati ur rasool wa hubbullah wa hubburasool"**_, further

  > **"مَنْ بَنَى مَسْجِدًا يُذْكَرُ فِيهِ اسْمُ اللَّهِ بَنَى اللَّهُ لَهُ
  بَيْتًا فِي الْجَنَّةِ"**
  >
  > **"Whoever builds a mosque in which the Name of Allah is mentioned, Allah
  will build a house for him in Paradise."**
  >
  > [Sunan Ibn Majah 735](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:735)

* **Methodology:** We (myself, my beloved parents MummyPappa, and InamMaryam)
  intend to actively participate in the construction of the masjid, ideally with
  our own hands, and ensure it includes a `madrasa` (Islamic school).

* **Provision:** Complete money, resources, and everything provided by ALLAH SWT
  alone in a halaal way to us, without any intermediaries, only between us and
  ALLAH SWT.

* **Legacy:** This masjid and madrasa becomes an asset for Islam and a means of
  success, mercy, and love of ALLAH SWT and love of Rasoolullah SAW in both the
  worlds to us (me, MummyPappa, InamMaryam) and our lineage above and below.

  the entire Ummah and humanity benefiting from me and the actions of my
  parents and family and lineage, by the Fazl of ALLAH SWT alone. Aameen.

  of ALLAH SWT, I ask ALLAH SWT to grant us (me, my Pyare MummyPappa,
  InamMaryam and family) a blessed Umrah in Ramadhan. Aameen.
* **Ultimate Aspiration:** I ask ALLAH SWT to accept me and guide me to
  HIMSELF while I'm inside salaah whilst I'm in my last sujood in the odd
  night of the last 10 nights of Ramadhan as a martyr in the
  Riyaz ul Jannah close to the Prophet Rasoolullah SAW with "subhana rabbi
  al a'la, la ilaha ill allah muhammadur rasoolullah saw" on my tongue.
  Aameen.
* **Aftermath:** After my martyrdom, may ALLAH SWT be pleased with me, and
  make my Rasoolullah SAW happy with me. Aameen.
* **For My Family:** After me, May ALLAH SWT make my parents and family
  amongst the righteous and raise us up with Rasoolullah SAW amongst
  Nabi'un, Siddiqeen, Shuhadah, was Saliheen under the shade of the throne
  of ALLAH SWT in the hereafter (Aakhirah) in complete happiness without
  fear and without grief "la khawfun alayhim wa la hum yahzanun". Aameen ya
  Rabbal Aalameen.
* This concludes my life goals in this category.

#### 2. **Shade of YOUR Throne, YA ALLAH SWT:**

YA ALLAH SWT, keep me, my MummyPappa, InamMaryam and all our family above and
below amongst those 7 blessed category of special people whom you shade under
the shade of YOUR ARSH on a day when no other shade is present except your

Rasoolullah SAW and his family and companions with mimbars of pearls and seats
of cushions. Aameen YA RABBAL AALAMEEN.
