# 🔥 overcome90x9: The Comeback

> 23 Sep '25 (30 Rabi1 '47) Tuesday - I've spiraled down to hit my all-time low. Faced the toughest week of self defeat and incompetence, a one full of shame, regret and guilt.
> Potential misused.
> Purpose dwindled.
> Promises broken.
> Self defeated.
> Imaan shaken.
> Time wasted.
> Ashamed.
> Lost.
> Even worse: misused the precious blessings of **ALLAH (SWT)** to trade for cheap.
>
> But I'm not done yet.
> We never despair from the mercy of ALLAH SWT (and from HIS love)
> So this is my way back. `My redemption arc`.
> If I invest my potential right, I can win big for me, my core team, and the Ummah in this **dunya and the aakhirah**.
>
> No more excuses. No more delays.
> Just pure **consistency**, **discipline**, and **100% effort unlocked**
>
> Reimagining, redefining, rediscovering and rewriting myself.
> Comeback is scripted and served.
> Let's register epic wins.
> My prime is loading....
> All to seek the pleasure of **ALLAH SWT**
> By following our beloved _RASOOLALLAH SAW._
>
> **Alhamdulillah.**
