> Promises broken.\
> Self defeated.\
> Imaan shaken.\
> Time wasted.\
> Ashamed.\

> Even worse: misused the precious blessings of **ALLAH (SWT)** to trade for
> cheap.

> Comeback is scripted and served.\
> Let's register epic wins.\
> My prime is loading....\

## My Time Warp

> Need to relive it in 6M to revive myself.

>> (360 * 4) / (30 * 6)
>> 1 Day of Real = 8 Days of Revive
>> 100M of Real = 1 Day of Revive 
```

## Focus Areas
