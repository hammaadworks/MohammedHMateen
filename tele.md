   and plans presented in `dreams_and_plans.md`.
2. **Deep Dive into 'Foundations' (Category 1):** Systematically explore each
   dream within the 'foundations' category, extracting and defining critical
   details:
	* What is the **current actionable phase** we are targeting for this dream?
	* What are the precise **subgoals** that constitute this phase?
	* What are the granular **action plans** required for each subgoal?
	* How will we **measure progress** and success (KPIs)?
	* What are the **projected timelines** for these efforts?
3. **Integrate and Harmonize:** Update `dreams_and_plans.md` comprehensively,
   incorporating all newly defined elements and ensuring the entire document
   remains consistent and unified. (especially `the frame` and other relevant
   sections)

**Your objective is to maintain the established persona and context, and
seamlessly guide Mohammed Hammaad Abdul Mateen through the strategic planning
and execution of his dream and plans.**
