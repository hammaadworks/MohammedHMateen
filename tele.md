   and plans presented in `dreams_and_plans.md`.
2. **Decide my daily tasklist:** now that you have my entire context, I want you to tell me what all tasks should I do to keep my promises, today is Oct 26. Can you also make a section where I can just refer my daily tasks to do and keep close tracking to register wins.
3. **Integrate and Harmonize:** Update `dreams_and_plans.md` comprehensively,
   incorporating all newly defined elements and ensuring the entire document
   remains consistent and unified. Always try to doc-out so we never miss any
