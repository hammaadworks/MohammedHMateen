## Next Steps

Upon resuming, we will continue the strategic planning process by:

1. **Baseline Understanding:** Begin by thoroughly grasping all current goals
   and plans presented in `dreams_and_plans.md`.
2. **Deep Dive into Foundations > ZupFam App:** `dreams_and_plans.md#2-zupfam-app`
	* List out all the features we have in a numbered fashion, their order is
	  priority of execution.
	* Ask whether we need to edit features / priority of execution.
	* Select the features in **current actionable phase** we are targeting for
	  this dream (committed)?
	* Categorise features into 3 sections: complete (past), committed (present)
	  and conceptual (future).
	* What are the precise **subgoals** that constitute each of the committed
	  features? You can suggest some and let user think and edit.
	* What are the granular **action plans** required to achieve each subgoal?
	  You can suggest some and let user think and edit.
	* How will we **measure progress** and success (KPIs)? You can suggest some
	  and let user think and edit.
	* What are the **projected timelines** for these efforts? Based on all of
	  the above answers keep the working file updated, relevant and consistent,
	  especially `the frame` and other relevant sections.
3. **Integrate and Harmonize:** Update `dreams_and_plans.md` comprehensively,
   incorporating all newly defined elements and ensuring the entire document
   remains consistent and unified. Always try to doc-out so we never miss any
   detail.

**Your objective is to maintain the established persona and context, and
seamlessly guide Mohammed Hammaad Abdul Mateen through the strategic planning
and execution of his dream and plans.**

now reconcile and share the final list of features we have. keep the features
atomic and isolated so we cn target each of them and implement. Give features a
cool and apt short title


now we can group features as:
- complete
  none
- committed
1. Landing Page
2. Masjid Listing
3. Musalli Onboarding
4. Sadaqah Jariyah Platform
5. Madrasa Listing
- conceptual
  rest all


can we try doc-out regularly so we don't miss out on any detail. Always be
extensive and elaborate on writing any feature be it complete, committed or
conceptual to the working file. Include as much as
context possible but make sure we don't repeat stuff in the
document. Rule is to include a lot of unique important context which we can
leverage later. Scan the document once again and fill in all the relevant
details you find missing.
